# Prior to the course

While you may already be aware of what [Music Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) is as well as the different technologies that implement it, we consider that it would be better that we all started from the same common point. Hence, we will now provide you some resources for you to check.

J. Stephen Downie, one of the main researchers in the field, provides a definition to MIR the scientific paper titled [Music Information Retrieval](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt611_08/downie_mir_arist37.pdf) considering a very specific use case (that, by the way, will be studied in the course): that of music search based on singing queries. Downie describes the challenges that such a system must face (*e.g.*, dealing with off-key singing, accuracy of the retrieval system, speed performance...) to provide an adequate response to the user query.

Nicola Orio, another reference researcher in the field, published the scientific review manuscript [Music Retrieval: A Tutorial and Review](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Download/INR-002) that summarizes all the different tasks and topics related to MIR, at least at the time. Note that, while it dates from 2006 and the technology for sure has evolved, the ground questions still are relevant nowadays.

More recently, Markus Schedl, Emilia Gómez, and Julián Urbano---also prominent researchers in MIR---published the book [Music Information Retrieval: Recent Developments and Applications](https://julian-urbano.info/files/publications/059-music-information-retrieval-recent-developments-applications.pdf) that deeply reviews the field, with a particular focus on audio data.

In a more practical sense, Meinard Müller recently presented a [tutorial](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C0/C0.html) with a large collection of Python Notebooks that deal with a large number of MIR topics in a more technical manner.

Finally, if you are further interested in the topic, you should visit the main webpage of the [International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR)](https://www.ismir.net/) in which a large number of resources including datasets, tutorials, scientific papers, and software tools are provided.
